Honestly, the reason I started dreaming of becoming an autonomous driving developer wasn't anything grand.
I happened to double major in Software & AI at a language-focused university and perhaps the biggest reason was that my favorite movie as a kid was Transformers?


(Now that I think about it, maybe those cars in the movie were a glimpse into the future of autonomous driving. 😉)


As I took more major-related courses and joined the [GDSC](https://gdsc.community.dev/)(Google Developer Student Club), I came across [Waymo](https://waymo.com) for the first time.
I had heard the term “self-driving” before but that was the first time I truly learned what the technology was and how far it had come.

Then one very very ordinary day, it hit me.
That the reason I was drawn into this mysterious field of autonomous driving—despite not being particularly passionate or disinterested in most things—was perhaps because of a feeling I’d carried with me for a long, long time.

<h3>🚲 When I was a child</h3>

We all have childhood memories that remain vivid no matter how much time passes. For me, it was the day I first learned to ride a bike.

Even back then, I wasn’t very good with physical activities (still not 😅), so I fell a lot. And I probably didn’t look forward to practice the next day either. But still, I got back on the bike—maybe it was because the sky was so beautifully blue that day. (TMI: I absolutely love blue skies.)


**If the sky hadn’t been that blue, I wonder if I’d still be on this path today.**

And I wonder how others learned to ride their first bike.

For me, my mom held onto the back of my bike while I practiced again and again. Eventually, I was able to ride on my own.
The moment I rode along the Han River for the first time is still so clear in my memory. It wasn’t just about getting from one place to another. It was about **'riding at my own pace, toward wherever I chose to go.'**

That wasn’t just movement—**it was 'freedom'.**

<h3>🌆 So, the road I'm taking is</h3>

When I made up my mind to become an autonomous driving developer, I felt that same emotion again. **What if anyone, anywhere, at any time,** could move freely—no matter the reason? If technology could make that happen, then it wouldn’t just be engineering.
It would be a form of technology for people—technology that protects and empowers.

And so I made a decision. It might sound strange but the person who helped me ride my bike back then couldn’t actually ride one herself. Just like her, I may still be lacking in many ways, but maybe I can become the kind of developer who holds the back of someone’s car—with care and quiet strength.

I may not build a flashy, shape-shifting Transformer.. But I want to become someone who quietly protects the everyday lives of others. ***<span style="color:steelblue;">'A developer you’d trust to take the wheel—because you know your road is safe behind them.'</span>***
